# Project: Web Home Budget Manager

**UPDATE:** A new `developer` branch with a TypeScript frontend version has been added.

**ðŸ”— [Live demo](https://budgetapp.msliwowski.net)**

**ðŸ§ª Test credentials:**  
`Username: testuser123`  
`Password: Testuser123!!`

## ðŸ’¡ Project Idea

The goal of this web application is to help users manage their household budgets. Each registered user can create a household (by simply entering a name â€“ no sensitive data required), invite housemates, and collaboratively manage household finances.

## ðŸš€ Features

Once registered and logged in, users must first create their household to use the application. After that, the following functionalities are available:

- Invite other housemates
- Add transactions (income and expenses)
- Internal chat between housemates
- Advanced financial statistics

Only the *host* (the user who created the household) can manage housemates â€” including the ability to remove any member.
